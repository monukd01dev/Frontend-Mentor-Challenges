## My process

Analyse the visuals of the challange think about the markup then code and after that apply styling.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flex-Box


### What I learned

- Learned to code some real-world stuff.
- Responsiveness using min, max height and width.
- Creating only by seeing design visually and taking assumption on dimensions.


### Continued development

I'll create some more projects like this before creating a whole website that would help me to achieve my main goal easily...

## Acknowledgments

Calmness and peace of mind is very important to code in CSS and writing structure in HTML, although this project is pretty simple I haven't need any help but I have used Gemini to recall some topography properties of css(I have forget about letter-spacing :).
